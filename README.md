# Sky High
This is a WebGL build of a Unity-based game coded in C#. It is a scrolling 2D platformer that I made in my free time.

The Game: 
- Navigate your way through an obstacle course high up in the sky
- Try to collect the coins and get the highest score possible
- The game progresses more quickly as time goes on
- The game is over when you fall

Controls: 
- move (WASD)
- jump (space)

Features: 
- double jump
- animated coin collectibles
- continuous level generation
